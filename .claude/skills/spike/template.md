<!--
Spike doc template. A spike is a time-boxed investigation of one task: it reaches the decisions a task needs, by analysis where possible and with evidence only where an unknown would change the choice. Its output is knowledge (decisions, answers, a verdict, inputs for designs and ADRs); its code is throwaway and lives in spikes/<name>/.
Blocks: Questions (what we need to know), Method (how we find out), Steps, Findings (filled during execution), Conclusion (filled after the last step).
Sections marked Optional are kept only when they apply.

## 1. Questions — what we need to know

### 1.1 Context

<!-- 2–4 sentences: the decisions this spike takes, which of them depend on evidence and why, and the spikes or designs it builds on. -->

### 1.2 Decided at framing

#### D`<N>`. `<Title of decision N>`

<!-- In this order, so the reader finds what matters first:
1. The decision and why, in one short paragraph. If it depends on a Q, name it and what happens if its Gate fails.
2. What would change it, and what would not, each with the action to take. Only when a later event could reopen it.
3. The options rejected and how robust the result is.
4. The evaluation behind it: the table or weighted matrix (needs, cuts, anchors and scores) if one was used. -->

### 1.3 Questions

<!-- The main question, answered by the Verdict. Then Q1..Qn, each answerable with evidence.
"Observe only": things to note during the run with no dedicated effort. -->

Main question: `<one sentence>`

- **Q1.** `<question>`
- **Observe only:** `<item>`

### 1.4 Exit criteria

<!-- Fixed before the first run; a later change is recorded in the Decision log.
Derived from the standard that applies to this kind of question, named in the first line: e.g. DAMA data quality dimensions for a data source, a weighted decision matrix for a technology choice.
Each criterion is measurable and says whether it is a hard cut or a guide. The timebox says what ends the run. State whether one variant meeting the criteria is enough. -->

- **Standard:** `<standard or pattern applied>`
- **Timebox:** `<window, and what ends it>`
- `<criterion>` — `<threshold>` — hard cut | guide

### 1.5 Out of scope

<!-- Optional. What someone could expect this spike to answer and it will not, each item pointing to the task that covers it. -->

- `<item>` — TNNN

### 1.6 Open questions

<!-- Optional. Unresolved questions about what to find out. Questions about how belong to Method. -->

| Question | Notes |
|---|---|
| | |

## 2. Method — how we find out

### 2.1 Approach

<!-- The variants, options or probes compared, and what each one tells that the others do not. -->

| Variant | What it is | What it tells |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

#### 2.1.1 Shared behaviour

<!-- Optional. Rules every variant follows (schedules, formats, key layouts, logs), stated once so the steps can cite them. -->

-

#### `<A>`. `<Title of variant, option or probe A>`

<!-- Detailed description -->

### 2.3 Decision log

<!-- It logs decisions about the method, before and during the run, including changes of course. Oldest first.
Entries follow .claude/rules/docs/decision-log.md (log only, change links).
- Column Applies to: anchor link(s) to the section where the decision is applied, named in one or two words (e.g. Q1, Probe A, File layout).
- Column Decided at: the Status phase where it was decided (Method, Steps), `<phase> review` when decided while reviewing that phase, or `Running step N` when decided during the run.
-->

| # | Applies to | Decision | Reason | Decided at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<N>` |  |  |  |  |

### 2.4 File layout

<!-- Every file and folder the spike creates, as a tree with its purpose in one line. Captured data and outputs are marked as ignored by Git (ADR-0009). The README is always included. -->

```text
spikes/<name>/
├── README.md        Question, setup and commands, what each script does, link to the report
└── <file>           <purpose>
```

## 3. Steps
<!-- Each step is one reviewable result, touching at most 2–3 files.
- Status: where the step is: 💤 todo · 🎬 ready · 🔄 in progress · ⛔ blocked · ✅ done
- Who: Owner (manual actions: dashboards, accounts, deploys, runs, checks) or Claude (code and documents).
- Commit: only in a step that changes committed files: the proposed message, following the Git conventions in CLAUDE.md.
- Model: the model and effort the step's session runs with (e.g. sonnet · medium), or — when Who is Owner.
- Gate: optional. <condition> → <consequence if it fails: variants or steps dropped or re-decided>. -->

### 3.1 Prerequisites

<!-- Owner actions outside the repo, each with its exact version or value and how to verify it. Write "None" when empty. -->

### Step 1 — `<title>`

- **Status:** 💤 todo
- **Who:** Owner
- **Commit:** following the Git conventions in CLAUDE.md.
- **Model:** `<model · effort>` (or —)
- **Gate:** `<condition>` → `<consequence>`

#### Scope

<!-- The result of the step. List the components and the files created or changed (code, tests, docs). A reviewer should know what the diff will contain from this section alone. -->

#### Reads

<!-- List of reads containing what to read (be specific with paragraph or line), what contains the read, and why it is interesting here.  -->

#### Do

<!-- Numbered actions in execution order, one verb each (write, implement, update, run). Every file named here must appear in Scope; add nothing Scope does not list. -->

#### Check

<!-- command/s or verification with a yes/no result. -->

## 4. Findings

<!-- Filled during the run, in the step that produces the evidence. One fact per finding: what was observed, the evidence (figures, tables) and its consequence for the spike. Numbering is never reused. An earlier finding is not rewritten to fit a later result; the later one says which finding it corrects. -->

### F1. `<one-line statement>`

Step N · YYYY-MM-DD · `<source of evidence>`

- `<evidence>`
- Consequence: `<for variants, steps or questions>`

## 5. Conclusion

<!-- Filled after the last step. Covers only the observed window. -->

Observed window: `<from–to, UTC; what it does not cover>`

### 5.1 Answers

- **Q1. Title** `<answer>` (FN)

### 5.2 Exit criteria

<!-- One result per criterion and variant. -->

| Criterion | Kind | Result | Findings |
|---|---|---|---|

### 5.3 Verdict

<!-- The answer to the main question in 2–3 sentences. -->

### 5.4 Not verified

<!-- What the evidence does not cover, each with its risk and mitigation. "None" is valid. -->

- `<item>` — `<risk>` — `<mitigation>`

### 5.5 Production inputs

<!-- Optional. What a later task must take into account when it builds, from any part of the spike: done when that task runs. Each one has a Destination: a design (with its task) or discarded with a reason. -->

| P | Input | Origin | Destination |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | | `<e.g. D1, #2, F3>` | |

### 5.6 Records

<!-- Documents this spike updates before it closes: ADRs from Decided at framing (each in its own commit), architecture, requirements, source cards and new tasks agreed with the owner. A decision that updates no document has no row. Commit: "Done", or "Pending" until delivered; the spike closes when every row is Done. Production inputs are not repeated here. -->

| Output | From | Destination | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<ADR, requirement, source card or task>` | `<e.g. D1, F3>` | `<document and section>` | `<Done, or Pending>` |

## 6. Sources

<!-- Optional. Earlier spikes, benchmarks and documentation used. -->
