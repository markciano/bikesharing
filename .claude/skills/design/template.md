<!--
Design doc template. A design doc is the working document of one task: Spec (what and why), Plan (how), Steps (implementation), Close (what was delivered).
It is detailed enough that Code can implement it without making design decisions.
Sections marked Optional are kept only when they apply.

# Design: `<title>`

- **Task:** TNNN
- **ADRs:** `<ADRs this design must respect, or "none">`
- **New ADRs from this doc:** `<ADRs created during this design, or "none">`

## Status

<!-- State: Draft 📝 · Ready for implementation 🎬 · In progress 🔄 · Complete ✅.
Phase: the blocks and reviews completed.
Current step: the step being implemented, or —. -->

- State: Draft 📝
- Phase: [ ] Spec · [ ] Plan · [ ] Plan review · [ ] Steps · [ ] Steps review
- Current step: —

## 1. Spec — what and why

<!-- What the result does seen from outside, not how it is built. The test: if whoever uses the result would notice a change, it belongs here; if not, it belongs to the Plan. External systems and their data (feeds, fields) may be named. -->

### 1.1 Context

<!-- 2–4 sentences for a reader with no prior context: the problem or need and why it matters now; who or what uses the result; where things stand today, including any design or spike this builds on. No solution here: it starts in Decided at framing. For a correction: current vs expected behaviour and how to reproduce it. -->

### 1.2 Decided at framing

<!-- Optional. One heading per decision about what the result does. In this order, so the reader finds what matters first:
1. The decision and why, in one short paragraph.
2. What would change it, and what would not, each with the action to take. Only when a later event could reopen it.
3. The options rejected.
4. The artefact that fixes it, in whatever form the decision needs (e.g. a mapping table, a page map, a weighted matrix). A security decision lists its threats in a table: `| # | Threat (STRIDE) | Impact | Control | Requirement |`, with IDs `TH1`, `TH2`… per document. -->

#### D`<N>`. `<Title of decision N>`

### 1.3 Requirements

<!-- Optional. The acceptance criteria, cited by number in the Test plan and the steps. They translate Decided at framing and cite the decision they come from; nothing is decided here.
One behaviour per requirement, verifiable, with a measurable threshold where one applies. Written in EARS:
- Ubiquitous: The <system> shall <response>.
- Event: When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.
- State: While <state>, the <system> shall <response>.
- Unwanted: If <condition>, then the <system> shall <response>.
- Optional: Where <feature is included>, the <system> shall <response>.
Only requirements specific to this task; project-wide rules (CLAUDE.md, ADRs) are not repeated. -->

- **R1** `<EARS statement>` (D`<N>`)

### 1.4 Done when

<!-- Optional. Only what closes this task and Requirements cannot express: operational actions, checks on real data, understanding. The general closing rule is checked in `.claude/skills/implement/review.md`. -->

- `<extra condition>`

### 1.5 Out of scope

<!-- Optional. What someone could expect and will not be done, each item pointing to the task that covers it. -->

- `<item>` — TNNN

### 1.6 Open questions

<!-- Optional. The decisions still to take about the what, in dependency order. Each one closes as a decision in Decided at framing and leaves the table, so it is empty at Spec approval. Questions about the how are Plan decisions. -->

| # | Question | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## 2. Plan — how

<!-- 2-3 sentences -->

### 2.1 Approach

<!-- Detailed plan organized by #### blocks.
Block `3. Steps` is written using this plan.
If some block contains `options considered`, include them with pros and cons.
-->

### 2.2 Decision summary

<!-- It logs decisions about the plan, including changes. Oldest first.
Entries follow .claude/rules/docs/decision-log.md (log only, change links).
- Applies to: anchor link(s) to the section where the decision is applied, named in one or two words.
- Decided at: the Status phase where it was decided (Plan, Steps), or `<phase> review` when decided while reviewing that phase.
- R: Requirement affected.
-->

| # | Applies to | Decision | Reason | R | Decided at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

### 2.3 Architecture

<!-- Optional. One diagram and 2–3 sentences. -->

### 2.4 File layout

<!-- Every file and folder the task creates or modifies, documents included, as a tree: (new) or (modified), and its purpose or change in one line. A task that adds a component also lists its CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (recipe in `.claude/rules/code/ci.md`), and its version files, manifest and lockfile (`.claude/rules/code/dependencies.md`). -->

```text
<path>/
└── <file>      (new)        <purpose>
```

### 2.5 Components

<!-- Optional. One subsection per component. The contract is exact, in the component's own language, never pseudocode. -->

#### `<ComponentName>`

- **Responsibility:** `<one sentence>`
- **Location:** `path/to/file`
- **Contract:**

```python
```

### 2.6 Test plan

<!-- Optional. Every requirement has at least one test, at the lowest level that can verify it. -->

| R | Test concept | Level |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | | unit / integration / e2e |

### 2.7 Breaking changes

<!-- Optional. Shared models or interfaces this design changes, and how their dependants are handled. -->

| File | Why it breaks | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

### 2.8 What does not change

<!-- Optional. Code or documents that must not be modified. Out of scope limits the what; this section limits the how. -->

-

## 3. Steps

<!-- Each step is one reviewable result and one commit, touching at most 2–3 files.
- Status: where the step is: 💤 todo · 🎬 ready · 🔄 in progress · ⛔ blocked · ✅ done
- Who: Owner (manual actions: dashboards, accounts, deploys, runs, checks) or Claude (code and documents).
- R: the requirements the step implements or tests, or —.
- Commit: the proposed message, following the Git conventions in CLAUDE.md.
- Model: the model and effort the step's session runs with (e.g. sonnet · medium), or — when Who is Owner. -->

### 3.1 Prerequisites

<!-- Owner actions outside the repo, each with its exact version or value and how to verify it. Write "None" when empty. -->

### Step 1 — `<Title>`

- **Status:** 💤 todo
- **Who:** Owner
- **Commit:** following the Git conventions in CLAUDE.md, including `<dNNN.sN - >` at the begining of the message, for the design and the step number.
- **R:** R1, R3 (or —)
- **Model:** `<model · effort>` (or —)

#### Scope

<!-- The result of the step. List the components, the files created or changed (code, tests, docs), and the tests from the Test plan that cover it. A reviewer should know what the diff will contain from this section alone. -->

#### Reads

<!-- List of reads containing what to read (be specific with paragraph or line), what contains the read, and why it is interesting here.  -->

#### Do

<!-- Numbered actions in execution order, one verb each (write, implement, update, run). Every file named here must appear in Scope; add nothing Scope does not list. -->

#### Check

<!-- command/s or verification with a yes/no result. -->

## 4. Close

<!-- The record of what the task delivered, for whoever opens this design later. -->

### 4.1 Implemented

<!-- Component — what was delivered; tests passing. -->

### 4.2 Known gaps at close

<!-- What the task leaves undone or imperfect, each with the task that covers it: requirements not fully met, File layout items not delivered, TODOs citing this task. "None" is valid. -->

- `<gap>` — TNNN

### 4.3 Decisions taken during implementation

<!-- Decisions made after the Plan was approved: <decision> — <reason>. "None" is valid. -->
